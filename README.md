Fromis_9 Profile

Design Process

My design process was simply to make a visually appealing website so that people would want to learn more about 
Fromis_9. If the website was colourful, people would want to look through it more and eventually learn more about Fromis_9 which ultimately is the goal.

Features

Slideshow - allows user to see how Fromis_9 has grown through the years and the different albums they have released
Form - allows user to choose which member they like when they are done looking through the website.
